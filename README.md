# Trivia Bot

## What is Trivia Bot

Trivia Bot is a fun and fully functional Discord bot that serves the purpose of satisfying your Trivia craving! There are many different modes of Trivia that you can play, either by yourself or with others in your Discord Server.

## Commands

There are many different commands you can use to interact with Trivia Bot. _This section will be evolving as we continue to add more features!_ Here is what we currently have going on:

-   `-play tf chill` Starts a round of chill T/F Trivia.
-   `-play tf competitive` **TODO**
-   `-play mc chill` **TODO**
-   `-play mc competitive` **TODO**
-   `-help` Lists out all the commands that Trivia Bot responds to, and what they do.
-   `-stop` Stops the bot.

You can also append `help` to any of the play commands to learn more about the different game modes, like so:

-   `-play tf help` Will list out all the different True & False game modes Trivia Bot can provide, and details about each.

_Note to devs: if we have time, we'll make more commands that respond to customizable game requests, like allowing the user to select how many questions they want, which category, which difficulty, and the time limit per question._

### Describe the problems. (10 minutes)

1. What is the core problem each bot is trying to solve?

    Since school and life in general has transitioned to being online, it has been difficult to participate in virtual events that are fun like they used to be. The problem this bot is trying to solve is the issue of feeling disconnected.

2. Why is it a problem worth solving?

    Just because life is virtual now, doesn't mean it has to be boring! School events and virtual gatherings shouldn't have to be bland just because we can't be together! Trivia Bot will bring the fun back to events like it used to be pre-pandemic. The goal is to make groups of people feel connected again.
