## What is Trivia Bot?

Trivia Bot is a fun and fully functional Discord bot that serves the purpose of satisfying your Trivia craving! There are many different modes of Trivia that you can play, either by yourself or with others in your Discord Server. We've made use of the Open Trivia Database API for the trivia questions that we use in the game, so shout out to them for the really cool API! You can find out more about that [here](https://opentdb.com/).

## Add to your server

Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=831974682709721099&permissions=161856&scope=bot) to add Trivia Bot to your Discord server! Tell all your friends, too!

## Commands

There are many different commands you can use to interact with Trivia Bot. _This section will be evolving as we continue to add more features!_ Here is what we currently have going on:

-   `!tfchill` Starts a round of chill T/F Trivia.
-   `!tfcompetitive` Starts a round of competitive T/F Trivia.
-   `!mcchill` Starts a round of chill Multiple Choice Trivia.
-   `!mccompetitive` Starts a round of competitive Multiple Choice Trivia.
-   `!help` Lists out all the commands that Trivia Bot responds to, and what they do.
-   ðŸ›‘ Stops the current Trivia game

The difference between `chill` and `competitive`:

`chill` allows all users to select an answer within the time limit
`competitive` only accepts the first correct answer; everyone else loses by default

You can also append any of the commands to `help` to learn more about the different game modes, like so:

-   `!help tfchill` Will give more detail about this specific game mode, for example.

_In the very near future, I will be implementing customizable time limits for the game modes, so stay tuned for that! Additionally, more work will be done to allow the bot to respond to customizable game requests, like allowing the user to select how many questions they want, which category, and which difficulty._
